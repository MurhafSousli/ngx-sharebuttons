not load FontAwesome icons out of the box. The user will have to import them manually\nExample:\nimport { ShareButtonsModule } from '@ngx-share/buttons';\n\nimport { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core';\nimport { faFacebook } from '@fortawesome/free-brand-svg-icons/faFacebook';\nimport { faTwitter } from '@fortawesome/free-brand-svg-icons/faTwitter';\nimport { faLinkedinIn } from
