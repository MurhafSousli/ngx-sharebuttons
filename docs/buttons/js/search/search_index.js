The user will have to import them manually\nExample:\nimport { ShareButtonsModule } from '@ngx-share/buttons';\n\nimport { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core';\nimport { faFacebook } from '@fortawesome/free-brand-svg-icons/faFacebook';\nimport { faTwitter } from '@fortawesome/free-brand-svg-icons/faTwitter';\nimport { faLinkedinIn } from

point to the current url, e.g. displaying a list of articles each one with share buttons.\n\nBreaking changes\n\nrefactor(ShareButtonsModule): angular-fontawesome has become a peer dependency.\nrefactor(Props): Button icon is type of IconProp which is imported from the @fortawesome icons package.\n\nBefore:\nstyle.scss\n@import
