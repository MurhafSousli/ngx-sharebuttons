<h4>Link Previews and Meta Tags</h4>
<p>When you share a link on social networks, the preview (including the title, description, and image) is generated from
  the meta tags in the page header. Social network apps fetch these meta tags using static meta information defined in
  the HTML of the page. This means that server-side rendering (SSR) is necessary to ensure the meta tags are accessible
  to the link scrapers. For more details, refer to the <a routerLink="../faq">"No article preview when a link is shared"</a> section.
</p>

<h4>Using Meta Tags inputs</h4>
<p>The meta tag inputs in this library are mainly used to set the sharer URL parameters, such as the URL for all buttons
  or the description for the WhatsApp button. The effectiveness of these inputs depends on the options provided by the
  specific social network.</p>

<note>
